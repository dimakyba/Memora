### Memora: An application for learning information by spaced repetition

## Annotation:

The purpose of this work is to develop a mobile application for learning information by spaced repetition, which allows users to create decks of cards containing text and images, import and export them, set up repetition times, and receive push notifications to optimize the memorization process. The application implements an interval repetition algorithm to improve learning efficiency.

stack:
+ Android Studio
+ Kotlin


TO-DO:
- [ ] class hierarchy
- [ ] main menu screen
- [ ] deck creation button
- [ ] create deck
- [ ] deck display after clicking
- [ ] card creation: text, picture, difficulty
- [ ] display the card in the deck
- [ ] view card when clicked
- [ ] mark as viewed
- [ ] popup menu when you press three dots view edit info delete
- [ ] customize push notifications
- [ ] implement 2 interval counting algorithms for two difficulties: difficult: frequent and fast. easy: infrequent and slow.
